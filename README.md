About the Program
-----------------
This program was a school project that I have cleaned up for portfolio
purposes. It was an early attempt to write a GUI interface using Qt Library,
stored data using SQLite and communicating via P2P techniques.  
It was never completed, but the included code is a proof of concept.  
It is recommended you read the source code to see exactly what the code is
doing.  
Please visit my portfolio at http://murraychristopherson.com/

If you discover any bugs or unclear/inconsistent documentation, please contact me
at murraychristopherson@gmail.com with a description of what happened, and I
will try and have a fixed version up shortly.

Installation
------------
To compile, open the project in Qt Creator and run from there.
